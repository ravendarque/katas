# Code katas

"A Code Kata is a small, fun problem that shouldnâ€™t take you more than an hour or two to solve in
your favourite programming language. The rule is that you must repeat the exercise, and every
time try to improve the way you solve the problem. Not just the code you end up with, but the
process by which you get to it."
